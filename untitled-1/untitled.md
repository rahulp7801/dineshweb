# AFK

## COMMANDS

### Everyone

```text
%afk <status>
```

This sets a status for you, so whenever someone pings you in the server you set it in, the status you set will show up.

### Moderator-only

```text
%afk clear <member>
```

In case someone abuses this command, a moderator can easily remove their status by running the above command. If you try to run this command and you are not a moderator, it will not run.

```text
%afk clearall
```

In case your server is raided or spammed, you can clear all of the AFK statuses from the members in your server, and get a fresh restart. This can only be used by members with the **Manage Server** permission.
