            <h2>InfiniBot Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h2>
            <h3 class="lastUpdated">Last Modified May 10, 2021</h3>
            <p>InfiniBot values its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") will help you understand how we collect
                and use personal information from those who visit our website or make use of our online facilities and
                services, and what we will and will not do with the information we collect. Our Policy has been designed and
                created to ensure those affiliated with InfiniBot of our commitment and realization of our obligation not
                only to meet, but to exceed, most existing privacy standards.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any given time. If you want to make sure that you are
                up to date with the latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page. If at any point in time the
                owners of InfiniBot decide to make use of any personal information on file, in a manner vastly different
                from that which was stated when this information was initially collected, the user or users shall be
                promptly notified. Users at that time shall have the option as to whether to permit the use of their
                information in this separate manner.</p>
            <p>This policy applies to InfiniBot, and it governs any and all data collection and usage by us. By using a
                command with InfiniBot, you are therefore consenting to the data collection procedures expressed in this
                Policy.</p>
            <p>Please note that this Policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that InfiniBot
                does not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by us. If you visit a website that we
                mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information. It is
                highly recommended and suggested that you review the privacy policies and statements of any website you
                choose to use or frequent to better understand the way in which websites garner, make use of and share the
                information collected.</p>
            <p>Specifically, this Policy will inform you of the following</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our website;</li>
                <li>Why we collect personally identifiable information and the legal basis for such collection;</li>
                <li>How we use the collected information and with whom it may be shared;</li>
                <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data; and</li>
                <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Information We Collect</strong></span></p>
            <p>It is always up to you whether to disclose your information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we
                reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services.</p>
            <p>In addition, InfiniBot may have the occasion to collect non-personal anonymous information, such as User ID,
                command usage, the Guild ID, and channel ID, which will assist us in providing and maintaining superior
                quality service.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why We Collect Information and For How Long</strong></span>
            </p>
            <p>We are collecting your data for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To better understand your needs and provide you with the services you have requested;</li>
                <li>To fulfill our legitimate interest in improving our services and products;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The data we collect from you will be stored for no longer than necessary. The length of time we retain said
                information will be determined based upon the following criteria: the length of time your personal
                information remains relevant; the length of time it is reasonable to keep records to demonstrate that we
                have fulfilled our duties and obligations; any limitation periods within which claims might be made; any
                retention periods prescribed by law or recommended by regulators, professional bodies or associations; the
                type of contract we have with you, the existence of your consent, and our legitimate interest in keeping
                such information as stated in this Policy.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Use of Information Collected</strong></span></p>
            <p>InfiniBot may collect and may make use of user information to assist in the operation of</p>
            <p>our bot and to ensure delivery of the services you need and request. We strive to make our bot the best it
                can possibly be, and to do that, we must take general, aggregated, and anonymous usage data to get a greater
                understanding on how the Bot is being used.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></span></p>
            <p>InfiniBot will not use or disclose the information provided by you except under the following</p>
            <p>circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>as necessary to provide services you have ordered;</li>
                <li>in other ways described in this Policy or to which you have otherwise consented;</li>
                <li>in the aggregate with other information in such a way so that your identity cannot reasonably be
                    determined;</li>
                <li>as necessary to enforce the Terms of Service;</li>
                <li>as necessary to maintain, safeguard and preserve all the rights and property of InfiniBot.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Non-Marketing Purposes</strong></span></p>
            <p>InfiniBot greatly respects your privacy. We do maintain and reserve the right to contact you if needed for
                non-marketing purposes (such as bug alerts, security breaches, account issues, and/or changes in InfiniBot
                products and services). In certain circumstances, we may use our website or other public means to post a
                notice.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Children under the age of 13</strong></span></p>
            <p>InfiniBot&rsquo;s services are not directed to, and does not knowingly collect personal identifiable
                information from, children under the age of thirteen (13). If it is determined that such information has
                been inadvertently collected on anyone under the age of thirteen (13), we shall immediately take the
                necessary steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our system's database, or in the
                alternative, that verifiable parental consent is obtained for the use and storage of such information.
                Anyone under the age of thirteen (13) must seek and obtain parent or guardian permission to use InfiniBot
                and Discord.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Opt-Out</strong></span></p>
            <p>All users and visitors to our website have the option to request the deletion of their data from us by way of
                email or joining our support server. To discontinue or unsubscribe from our website please join our support
                server <a href="https://discord.gg/4VnUA8ZXyH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. If you wish to
                unsubscribe or opt-out from any third-party websites, you must go to that specific website to unsubscribe or
                opt-out. InfiniBot will continue to adhere to this Policy with respect to any personal information
                previously collected.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></span></p>
            <p>Our service does contain links to affiliates and other websites. InfiniBot does not claim nor accept
                responsibility for any privacy policies, practices and/or procedures of other such websites. Therefore, we
                encourage all users and visitors to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements
                of every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy Agreement applies
                only and solely to the information collected by our services</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Notice to European Union Users:</strong></span></p>
            <p>InfiniBot&rsquo;s operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide information to us,
                the information will be transferred out of the European Union (EU) and sent to the United States. (The
                adequacy decision on the EU-US Privacy became operational on August 1, 2016. This framework protects the
                fundamental rights of anyone in the EU whose personal data is transferred to the United States for
                commercial purposes. It allows the free transfer of data to companies that are certified in the US under the
                Privacy Shield.) By providing your information to us, you are consenting to its storage and use as described
                in this Policy.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Security</strong></span></p>
            <p>InfiniBot takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the
                website or the bot, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive
                information (e.g. credit card information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure
                way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the
                beginning of the address of the webpage.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your</p>
            <p>information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing
                or customer service) are granted access to your information. The computers and servers in which we store
                personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss,
                misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the user's personal information under our
                control.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong></span></p>
            <p>By running a command with the bot, you are hereby accepting the terms and conditions stipulated within the
                Privacy Policy Agreement. If you are not in agreement with our terms and conditions, then you should refrain
                from further use of our services. In addition, your continued use of our services following the posting of
                any updates or changes to our terms and conditions shall mean that you agree and accept such changes.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to Contact Us</strong></span></p>
